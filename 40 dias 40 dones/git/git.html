<h2>Vocabs Git</h2>
<h3>GIT BASICS</h3>
<p><b>git init</b>creates an empty Git repository in specified directory. Runs directly the current directory as a git repository</p>
<p><b>git clone</b>Clone repo located at "repo" into local machine. Original repo can be located on the local filesystem or on a remote machine via HTTP or SSH. </p>
<p><b>git config user.name "name"</b> define author name to be used for all commits in current repo. Devs commonly use --global flag to set config options for current user.</p>
<p><b>git add "directory"</b>Stage all changes in "directory" for the next commit. Replace "directory" with a "file" to change a specific file.</p>
<p><b>git commit -m "message"</b> Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor, use "message" as the commit message. </p>
<p><b>git status</b> List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked.</p>
<p><b>git log</b>Display the entire commit history using the default format. For customization see additional options.</p>
<p><b>git diff</b> Show unstaged changes between your index and working directory.</p>

    <h2>Git</h2>
    <h3>UnderStanding Git</h3>
    <p>Git is a version control system.</br>

        Git helps you keep track of code changes.</br>
        
        Git is used to collaborate on code in a terminal.</p>
        <p>git --version</br>
            <mark>git version 2.30.2.windows.1</mark></p>
        <p>In the code above, you can see commands (input) and output/response</br></p>


    <h2>Configure Git</h2>
    <h3>Git getting started</h3>
    <p>Now let Git know who you are. This is important for version control systems, as each Git commit uses this information:</p>
    <p>git config --global user.name "TairoMu√±oz"</br>
        <mark>git config --global user.email "socialtairo@gmail.com"</mark></p>
    <p>In the code above, you can see commands (input) and output/response</br></p>
<p>Change the user name and e-mail address to your own. You will probably also want to use this when registering to GitHub later on.</p>
<p><mark>Note: Use global to set the username and e-mail for every repository on your computer.</br>

    If you want to set the username/e-mail for just the current repo, you can remove global</mark></p>
<h3>Creating Git Folder</h3>
<p>Now, let's create a new folder for our project:</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>mkdir myproject</p>
<p>cd myproject</p>
<p>mkdir makes a new directory.</p>
<p>cd changes the current working directory.</p>
<p>Now that we are in the correct directory. We can start by initializing Git!</p>
<p><mark>Note: If you already have a folder/directory you would like to use for Git:</br>

    Navigate to it in command line, or open it in your file explorer, right-click and select "Git Bash here"</mark></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Initialize Git</h3>
<p>Once you have navigated to the correct folder, you can initialize Git on that folder:</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>git init </p>
<p>Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/user/myproject/.git/</p>
<p>You just created your first Git Repository!</p>
<p>Note: Git now knows that it should watch the folder you initiated it on.</p>
<p>Git creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes.</p>
<p>Initialize Git on the current folder:</p>
<p>git init</p>

<!-- <h3>Git New Files</h3> -->

<h3>Git New Files</h3>
<h4>Git Adding New Files</h4>
<p>You just created your first local Git repo. But it is empty.</p>
<p>So let's add some files, or create a new file using your favourite text editor. Then save or move it to the folder you just created.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how to create a new file using a text editor, you can visit our HTML tutorial: HTML Editors</p>
<p>For this example, I am going to use a simple HTML file like this:</p>
<p>And save it to our new folder as index.html.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the terminal and list the files in our current working directory:</p>
<p>ls index.html</p>
<p>ls will list the files in the directory. We can see that index.html is there.</p>
<p>Then we check the Git status and see if it is a part of our repo:</p>
<p>git status
    On branch master
    
    No commits yet
    
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)
        index.html
    
    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)</p>
<p>Now Git is aware of the file, but has not added it to our repository!</p>
<p>Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states:</p>
<p>Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository</p>
<p>Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository</p>
<p> When you first add files to an empty repository, they are all untracked. To get Git to track them, you need to stage them, or add them to the staging environment.</p>
<p>We will cover the staging environment in the next chapter.</p>


<!-- Git Staging environment -->

<h3>Git Staging Environment</h3>
<p>One of the core functions of Git is the concepts of the Staging Environment, and the Commit.</p>
<p>As you are working, you may be adding, editing and removing files. But whenever you hit a milestone or finish a part of the work, you should add the files to a Staging Environment.</p>
<p>Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on. You will learn more about commit shortly.</p>
<p>For now, we are done working with index.html. So we can add it to the Staging Environment:</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>git add index.html</p>
<p>The file should be Staged. Let's check the status::</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>git status
    On branch master
    
    No commits yet
    
    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached ..." to unstage)
        new file: index.htmlgit status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached ..." to unstage)
    new file: index.html</p>
<p>Now the file has been added to the Staging Environment.</p>
<h3>Git Add More than One File</h3>
<p>You can also stage more than one file at a time. Let's add 2 more files to our working folder. Use the text editor again.</p>
<p>A README.md file that describes the repository (recommended for all repositories):</p>
<p><b> Example </b>  </p>
<p># hello-world
    Hello World repository for Git tutorial
    This is an example repository for the Git tutoial on https://www.w3schools.com
    
    This repository is built step by step in the tutorial.</p>
<p>A basic external style sheet (bluestyle.css):</p>
<p>Example
    body {
    background-color: lightblue;
    }
    
    h1 {
    color: navy;
    margin-left: 20px;
    }</p>
<p>And update index.html to include the stylesheet:</p>
<p>Example: index.html
<p>Now add all files in the current directory to the Staging Environment:</p>
<p><b>git add --all  </b>  </p>
<p><b>  </b>Using --all instead of individual filenames will stage all changes (new, modified, and deleted) files.  </p>
<p><b> Example </b>  </p>
<p><b>  </b> git status
    On branch master
    
    No commits yet
    
    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached ..." to unstage)
            new file:   README.md
            new file:   bluestyle.css
            new file:   index.html </p>

<p><b>  </b> Now all 3 files are added to the Staging Environment, and we are ready to do our first commit. </p>
<p><b>  Note: The shorthand command for git add --all is git add -A</b>  </p>
<p><b> Git Commit </b>  </p>
<p><b>  </b> Since we have finished our work, we are ready move from stage to commit for our repo. </p>
<p><b>  </b> Adding commits keep track of our progress and changes as we work. Git considers each commit change point or "save point". It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change. </p>
<p><b>  </b> When we commit, we should always include a message. </p>
<p><b>  </b> By adding clear messages to each commit, it is easy for yourself (and others) to see what has changed and when. </p>
<p><b> Example </b>  </p>
<p><b>  </b> 
    git commit -m "First release of Hello World!" </br>
    [master (root-commit) 221ec6e] First release of Hello World!</br>
     3 files changed, 26 insertions(+)</br>
     create mode 100644 README.md</br>
     create mode 100644 bluestyle.css</br>
     create mode 100644 index.html </p>
<p><b>  </b> The commit command performs a commit, and the -m "message" adds a message. </p>
<p><b>  </b> The Staging Environment has been committed to our repo, with the message:
    </p>
<p><b>  </b>  "First release of Hello World!" </p>
<p><b> Git Commit without Stage </b>  </p>
<p><b>  </b> Sometimes, when you make small changes, using the staging environment seems like a waste of time. It is possible to commit changes directly, skipping the staging environment. The -a option will automatically stage every changed, already tracked file. </p>
<p><b>  </b> Let's add a small update to index.html: </p>
<p><b>  </b>  </p>
<p><b>Example  </b>  </p>
<p><b>  </b> And check the status of our repository. But this time, we will use the --short option to see the changes in a more compact way: </p>
<p><b> Example </b>  </p>
<p><b>git status --short
    M index.html  </b>  </p>
<p><b>Note: Short status flags are:  </b>  </p>
<p><b> ?? - Untracked files</br>
    A - Files added to stage</br>
    M - Modified files</br>
    D - Deleted files </b>  </p>
<p><b>  </b>We see the file we expected is modified. So let's commit it directly:  </p>
<p><b>  </b>git commit -a -m "Updated index.html with a new line"</br>
    [master 09f4acd] Updated index.html with a new line</br>
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)  </br></p>
<p><b>Warning: Skipping the Staging Environment is not generally recommended.  </b>  </p>
<p><b> Skipping the stage step can sometimes make you include unwanted changes.</b>  </p>
<p><b>  </b>  </p>
<p><b> Git Commit Log </b>  </p>
<p><b>  </b> To view the history of commits for a repository, you can use the log command: </p>
<p><b>  </b> 
    git log</br>
    commit 09f4acd3f8836b7f6fc44ad9e012f82faf861803 (HEAD -> master)</br>
